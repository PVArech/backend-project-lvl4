Task-manager contains only the bare minimum: users, tasks, statuses, and labels. An advanced task filtering mechanism has been implemented.
To authenticate users in the project, a library implemented on the basis of Passport is used.
Thanks to Bootstrap and Webpack, users of the service are provided with a convenient, responsive, beautiful, modern interface.
